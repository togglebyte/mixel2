Viewport malarkey:
------------------

* Creating a canvas with no pre-existing canvases
  places the new canvas in the empty viewport
* Splitting a viewport places the existing canvas 
  in the new viewport
* Loading an image will load it into the active
  viewport.
* Close a viewport extends existing viewports
  into the available space
